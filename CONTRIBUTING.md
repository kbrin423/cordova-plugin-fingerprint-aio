# Contributing

* Fork
* Create new feature branch (git checkout -b feature-or-fix-something)
* Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add fix for android ...')
* Push to the branch (git push origin feature-or-fix-something)
* Create new Pull Request with description what you did and why you did it

## Tips
* Please avoid changing the indentation of a complete file in your pull request, because that makes reviewing changes hard
* Use the command `npm test PLATFORM` to run automatic and manual tests first
